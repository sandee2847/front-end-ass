<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The findSquare function is a JavaScript utility that determines the largest possible side length of a square that can be formed from contiguous subarrays of an input array, where each element in the subarray is at least as large as the side length of the square.</p>

<h2>Function Description</h2>
<p>The findSquare function iterates through possible side lengths, starting from 1, and checks if there exists any contiguous subarray of that length where every element is at least as large as the side length. The function returns the largest possible side length that satisfies this condition.</p>

<h2>How to test the function and see the result</h2>
<p>1. Install Node.js</p>
<p>2. Create a JavaScript File</p>
<p>3. Add the Code to the File</p>
